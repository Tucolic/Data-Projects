# Data Analyst Projects

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio!

Hi, my name is Benjamin Cai and I am an aspiring Data Analyst working on my experience utilizing tools and technologies to collect, organize, analyze and visualize data. I have an analytical background in Economics and currently learning to become an expert in analytics. 
I am proficient in Excel, SQL and Tableau and have a solid understading of data analytical techniques such as statistical analytics, building dashboards, data merging, critical thinking and keen eye to detail.

During my studies, I have honed my ability to work with big and complex data sets and developed a keen eye to detail to identifying any trends and patterns. For example, I have posted my research paper on the Minimum Legal Drinking Age where I analyzed large sets of data
and utilized data analytical techniques to translate those data sets into visualization and summaries for better digestion of information for the readers.

In this portfolio, I am going to constantly add new projects that showcase my data analytical abilities. These are all learning projects as I am no expert in the field at the moment, but I hope to start my career in data analytics and hopefully learn about wonders and impact
of data.

This is a repository to showcase my skills and track my learning progress in Data Analytics / Data Science. Enjoy!
